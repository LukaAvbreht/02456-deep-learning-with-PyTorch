# Projects

## external

1. Looking at ct-scans of horses (20)
    * Classification problem
    * deep networks

2. (Don't) Bayesian optimization
    * optimizing functions that are hard to evaluate (21)
    * trying yo approximate this function

3. Control of water treatment plant (10) (looks cool)
    * train a prediction model on the drinking water system model

4. text project (8) Remove errors in texts.
    * integrate kowladge base to the text correction

5. brainwaves project. (Interesting) (9)
    * Epilepsy and sleep
    * Brainwaves are week and noisy. They change a lot, hard to quantify
    * build deep learning model and buid a system to detect outliers
    * quality control on eag!! (see if the data is good enough to use in to make medical decisions)

6. voice processing (5)
    * audio for speech enhancements
    * acoustic design
    * projects they offer:
        * low-complexity voice activity detection
        * eliminate reverberation using deep-learning

7. Use deep learning to make automotive factories (2)
    * a,b,c and d projects on the google drive doc
    * also offer student jobs (:P)

## internal

1. Natural language processing
    * gather text, linguistic understanding. how do we design chat-boots.
    * why is nlp hard:
        * include your children when baking cookies
        * The pope's baby steps on gays
    * projects:
        * language modeling (predict the next word typed)
        * translation (often industry specific translations work much better)
        * summarization (take the document and summarize it). Make small text about large articles you have
        * bioinformatics (protein detection...)
            * finding words in proteins
            * generate specific proteins
            * AI expo today !! (ml reaserher from ku)

2. Reinforcement learning (
    * 3 week introduction to reiforcement learning
    * projects:
        * deep q-netorks
        * automatic machine learning (train a neural network to build good neural networks)
        * distributed deep RL

3. Deep fashion (7)
    * idea is to take an image of model and synthesize same model with different clothes

4. 2d conditional density estimation (where staff will be in certian time)
5. generalization of population of denmark
6. generate models of cities (generate better, new cities)
7. Time series prediction of spation-temporal mobility data
     * understand shared mobility
8. oultier detection in the oceans
9. traffic 4-cast
    * based on competition
    * predict some traffic parameters
10. Smartphone data fusion

11. Music generator
    * music transformer (switch styles of music)

12. (13) and (24) controlled language generation
    * generate text with contest, conditional generating of text

13. Meta learning (how to adapt fast to new data)
     * self driving cars
     * medicine (adaptation to new population)

14. (14) Visual grounding.
    * combining language and images. Get the description of the image
    * goal directed agents

15. Bayesain neural networks
    * point estimates for network
    * do that with some bayesian uncertainty. Weights are a probability function
    * comparison with other neural networks.
    * how cerian can we ba on the results based on whether we saw images in this "area". With similar specs

16. Generative modeling

17. AI expo for more
    * algorithmic faliture
    * what happend when models dont work as supposed
    * reproduce the paper on some stuff

18. haring aids project
    * Hearing configuration based on user and contest
    * Give user's some parameters, and then they choose which one seems the best for them
        * less backgroud
        * to noisy
        * ...

19. project with dtu aqua
    * identify the fish in the sea

20. Public data and inhouse data to predict bacrupcy (25)

21. Generate trainig data from other data (use machine learing to generate training data)
    * adding noise
